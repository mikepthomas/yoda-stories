Reverse engineering data files for the game Yoda Stories.

Java application to extract assets from the game Yoda Stories.

The game is available on [a few abandonware sites](http://bfy.tw/MkrB) and should be extracted to the `/src/main/resources` directory.

The [generated maps](https://github.com/mikepthomas/yoda-stories/tree/master/src/site/resources/maps) can be opened in the [Tiled map editor](http://mapeditor.org).
